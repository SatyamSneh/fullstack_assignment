The assignment consists of mainly two parts - 
- Building APIs
- Consuming APIs

## Building APIs
You are free to use any language and framework along with any database of your choice as long as the APIs cover the following bare minimum - 
- User authentication
- A table consisting of restaurant details (id, name, address); another table containing dishes (id, name, thumbnail path); and a final table restuarant dish mapping (restuarant_id, dish_id)
Points to note -
- Bonus points for using PHP, Laravel, MySQL stack
- If you do not have much experience building APIs, you should take a look at LoopBack (Google it!) which will have you up and running in about 10 minutes with user authentication built-in.

## Consuming APIs
Create a __responsive__ web client which shows listing of restaurants (after fetching restaurants via the API) and on clicking a restaurant, shows the dishes that particular restaurant serves. For authentication, create a login and singup page as well and appropriately consume the auth APIs here.
Points to note -
- There is a lot of creative freedom here which has been given to not limit the thinking of the applicant and to provide room for flexibility. Use it to your advantage.
- Bonus points for using any framework such as Angular or Vue.

## Other Important points
Please include detailed instructions to run the app, including dependencies list and installation guidelines. It would be terrific if you are able to deploy it (perhaps using Heroku or GCP free $300 credits) and include a link to the hosted app. Comment your code wherever required.
